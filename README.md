# Arduino Bridge Lift Project

This project uses an Arduino and DC motor to lift and lower a miniature bridge via a spider pulley mechanism.

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- Arduino UNO
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- DC Motor
- Pulley system
- External Power Supply (9V–12V)
- Jumper wires

## ⚙️ Features
- Clockwise motor rotation to lift the bridge
- Anticlockwise rotation to lower it
- Time-based control using delays

## 📂 Code
The `bridge_lift.ino` file contains the code for motor direction and speed control.

## 🖼️ Project Description
The bridge is lifted via strings connected to various points, held by a pulley structure. Controlled through L298N and Arduino.

## 💡 To Do
- Add push-button control
- Add limit switches for safety
